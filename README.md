# MuscularDemo

This code uses the MuscularModel classes and other code to create a workstation that allows to simulate a model,
control it via a GUI, and observe a graph that is plotted with real-time values of the model with the class _LiveGraph_.

To simulate and view the model it uses the classes in the repository [MuscularModel](https://github.com/gubena/MuscularModel)
and the library [PBox2D](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing).
To control the simulation and to create the several windows on the workstation it uses the library G4P.
To view the values of the model plotted on a graph the repository [LiveGraph](https://github.com/gubena/LiveGraph) is used.

This code comes with 2 anatomically correct models, one of the upper arm (biceps and triceps):

And one of the lower leg (calves, soleus and tibialis anterior):

Here is a video explaining and demonstrating how the program works:
